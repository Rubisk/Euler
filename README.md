Solutions to some [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives) problems. Most solutions are not (well) documented as this was mostly a hobby project. Most solutions can be executed as 
```console
python problem_x.py <problem_input>
```
where `problem_input` (usually) is some integer depending on the problem.
